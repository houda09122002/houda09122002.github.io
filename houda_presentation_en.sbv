Hello everyone! I'm Houda Khiati, a passionate full-stack developer,

0:00:05.680,0:00:10.960
currently doing my work-study program at Equativ. If you're looking for someone who brings both

0:00:10.960,0:00:16.520
technical expertise and a sharp sense of real-world impact, you're in the right place.

0:00:17.160,0:00:23.360
I'm in my final year at Institut Galilée – Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, and my journey

0:00:23.360,0:00:27.920
so far has allowed me to gain a rare combination of technical and functional skills.

0:00:27.920,0:00:34.360
Let me give you a few concrete examples. At Lafarge Holcim,

0:00:34.360,0:00:39.280
I developed a web application using Angular and SpringBoot to manage access and

0:00:39.280,0:00:46.520
real-time attendance — a direct impact, immediate results. At Marjane Holding,

0:00:46.520,0:00:51.560
I dove into data analysis with R and Power BI, helping to

0:00:51.560,0:00:56.560
optimize store layout based on real customer behavior.

0:00:57.240,0:01:03.320
Now at Equativ, I'm focused on internal tools — making workflows smarter,

0:01:03.320,0:01:09.000
improving user experience, and ensuring data reliability at every

0:01:09.000,0:01:17.000
step. What drives me? I thrive in dynamic, human environments, where

0:01:17.000,0:01:24.240
technology truly serves continuous improvement. Collaboration, inclusion, and real

0:01:24.240,0:01:29.760
social or environmental impact aren't just buzzwords for me — they're core values.

0:01:29.760,0:01:36.880
I speak French, English, and Arabic, and I'm always eager to learn, create meaningful solutions,

0:01:36.880,0:01:42.000
and bring my energy to a team with purpose.
